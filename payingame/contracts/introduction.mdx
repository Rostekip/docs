Instead of having a game or SaaS Solution bound to one chain, Payingame allows you to connect your product to all chains that Payingame supports.
This has major consequences:

- You will be able to mint NFT's on all chains
- You will be able to craft items on any chain or combination (example, 2 wood on ETH chain and 1 cloth on Avax gives a bow on Ronin)
- You can attach any payment from that chain or Fiat to buy the NFT
- Your customers will be able to play the game (or use your product) on the chain they desire but your product will know what that person owns, independent on the chain.
- Your customers can even have multiple items on different chains. Through the use of our uniform Api, your product does not need to know where those items reside.

This enables you to do neat stuff like promoting a certain chain by only minting special items on that chain. And mint other special items on others.
Or if you see that your product does not do well on one chain, you could shift to another chain without doing <b>any change</b> in code.

We created universal contracts on all chains to support this groundbraking implementation. And you have total control which chain(s) you want to enable.
Once you enabled the contract, you are good to go! Its that simple...
