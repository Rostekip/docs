This is a background task and can take up to one minute before they show up.

The list will give you those that are already used and/or exported.

You can give the vouchers now to whomever you want. If you wish to export the list so that you can do some housekeeping, this is possible as well.

- Export New: Only new vouchers will be exported. The ones already exported will not be in the new list.
- Export All: All vouchers will be exported.
