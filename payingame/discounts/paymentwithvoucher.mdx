Once the system detects that there are valid vouchers available for the product, a new input becomes available in the payment page.

<img

  alt="addproject"
  height="100"
  className="rounded-lg"
/>

The user can then enter the discount code and press on 'Apply'. The price will then be adjusted accordingly.

Remark:

Once a discount code is applied, it will be active for the duration of the sale. As a sale has a maximum of 5 minutes, it will thus not be possible to add it to another sale for that timeframe.
