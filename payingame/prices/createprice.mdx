You will see 2 different payments:

- Fiat payments: This enables you to sell items through credit card or any other form of fiat payment. For more information click <a href="/payingame/prices/fiatpayments">Here</a>
- Crypto payments: This enables you to sell items with crypto. For more information click <a href="/payingame/products/createproduct">Here</a>

If both buttons are on "Enable" it means you still need to define the payment methods. You will need to click on one of these two buttons to onboard the type of payment.
If one of the two is on 'Enabled', you can start giving in prices.

Once you click on 'Add', the following popup will appear
