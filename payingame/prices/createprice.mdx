You will see 2 different payments:

- Fiat payments: This enables you to sell items through credit card or any other form of fiat payment. For more information click <a href="#">Here</a>
- Crypto payments: This enables you to sell items with crypto. For more information click <a href="/payingame/products/createproduct">Here</a>

If both buttons are on "Enable" it means you did not decide yet for this game what kind of payments you want to foresee. You will need to click on one of these two buttons to onboard the type of payment.
