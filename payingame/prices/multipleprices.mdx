title: "Multiple Price schemes"
description: "You can create multiple price schemes for the same product. This means that a buyer will be able then to select out of these different prices."

An example would be that you offer a certain product at a certain price, while you have it as well grouped with another product for a cheaper one.

To do so, create the prices for the same product twice. See below how it would look like.

<img

  alt="addproject"
  height="100"
  className="rounded-lg"
/>

Once a buyer would then go to the payment page, they would see this

<img
  src="/images/pricescheme.png"
  alt="addproject"
  height="100"
  className="rounded-lg"
/>

They would then have the option to select one of the two prices (so in above example they could opt to buy one product or the grouped one)
