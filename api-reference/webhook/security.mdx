description: "In order to provide extra security, you can receive an extra header in the webhook. This header lets you verify that the webhook was sent by Payingame, not a malicious third party."
---

By default this is off, but we recommend to enable this feature. This can be done by going into the webhook and press on 'Generate Key'.

<img
  src="/images/webhookreturn.png"
  alt="addproject"
  height="100"
  className="rounded-lg"
/>

This can be generated at any time, but more important you can override an existing one. So please be careful using this feature if you already have set up a complete working environment.

Once you confirm in the popup, the following screen will appear

<img
  src="/images/showsecret.png"
  alt="addproject"
  height="100"
  className="rounded-lg"
/>

You can then copy this key and save it. You will need it to validate the signature that Payingame will provide.

<b>
  As the message states, the key will only be visible once and will not be
  available anymore. If you loose this key, you will need to regenerate a new
  one.
